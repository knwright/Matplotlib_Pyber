# Matplotlib_Pyber
Using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Jypyter Notebook, the objective was to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcased the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Produced the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
